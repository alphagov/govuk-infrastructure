        ## Firebreak guidelines
        A **Firebreak** is typically a two‚Äëweek sprint in which the team works on tasks **outside the normal roadmap** with clear benefit to **GOV.UK** ‚Äì ideally also to **Platform Engineering**.

        Valid activities include:
        * Exploring new tools or technologies
        * Paying down technical debt
        * Experimenting with new ways of working
        * Fixing long‚Äëstanding issues that hurt the platform

        **During Firebreak, you still need to**:
        * Attend daily stand‚Äëups
        * Cover the Platform Support rota & respond to enquiries
        * Remain on‚Äëcall if you're scheduled
        * Help with urgent incidents if needed

        You'll _pitch_ this proposal in a 2‚Äì3‚ÄØminute slot at the team‚Äôs Firebreak planning session.

        At the end of Firebreak, you must:
        * Demo your work in the team's Show‚Äëand‚ÄëTell session
        * Document findings in the team drive
        * Tear down any ephemeral environments
        * Merge or mark draft any open PRs
        * Close or move this issue to the backlog
