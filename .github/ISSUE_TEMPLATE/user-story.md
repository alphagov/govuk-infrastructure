I want (some action): This describes what the user wants to do. It should be a specific action or feature.

so that (some result): This is the reason or benefit that the user expects from performing the action.

Functional Requirements: Here, you list what you are going to do - the functional requirements associated with the user story. These could be based on what you learned from the stakeholder interviews, what functionality they need.

[Non-Functional Requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement): Here, you list how you are going to do it - the non-functional requirements associated with the user story. These could be about the system's performance, security, usability, standards etc, these are likely more technical than the functional requirements description.
