# Configure synonyms for terms that aren't semantically equivalent to a general-purpose semantic
# search engine. Use sparingly when there is a clear need because the search engine doesn't
# automatically pick up on the relationship between equivalent terms.
#
# Each key in this file represents the ID and displayName of a serving control with a synonym
# action. It should contain an array of words that the search engine should consider equivalent.
#
# IMPORTANT: The ID needs to be between 1-63 characters and *unique both within this file and
# amongst all controls*! Stay consistent by using `syn_` as the prefix for any synonym control added
# in this file.

# TODO: Adding a single synonym for test purposes. This should be extended with a curated set of
# synonyms based on the list in Search API v1 (but seriously trimmed as there are many in there that
# are no longer necessary).
syn_hmrc:
  - inland revenue
  - hmrc
  - hm revenue and customs
