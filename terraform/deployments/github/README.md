# GOV.UK GitHub Infrastructure configuration

> **Note**: Currently this module can only be applied by an alphagov GitHub
Organisation Admin.

This module configures GitHub resources so that the platform can automatically give permissions to
repositories with specific properties in the included YAML file.

We no longer use GitHub topics (tags) on repositories (similar to
annotations on Kubernetes resources) to configure or enable platform functionality.

Instead, creating an ECR registry and giving permissions to push to the
registry might be enabled by setting `can_be_deployed` to `true` in the YAML file.

This module configures repositories with sensible defaults such as
protecting the `main` branch.

## Applying Terraform

1. Generate access token, needs to be a GitHub admin for `alphagov` org
  1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
  2. Create a new token with permissions `admin:org` and `public_repo`
2. Configure Terraform
  ```shell
  gds aws govuk-production-poweruser -- \
    terraform init -backend-config production.backend -upgrade
  ```
3. Plan Terraform
  ```shell
  GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> gds aws govuk-production-poweruser -- terraform plan
  ```
4. Apply Terraform
  ```shell
  GITHUB_TOKEN=<token> gds aws govuk-production-poweruser -- terraform apply
  ```

## Creating and configuring a new repository

To create and configure a **new** repository, you will need to raise a Pull Requests to add it to [repos.yml](/terraform/deployments/github/repos.yml) file and apply terraform changes in Terraform Cloud.
You can use the existing repository configurations as examples. For detailed property definitions, refer to the [associated JSON schema](/terraform/deployments/github/schemas/repos.schema.json).

### Configuring required status checks

Use the predefined anchors for consistency. For Ruby on Rails applications use:
```
standard_contexts: *standard_govuk_rails_checks
```

For other software use:
```
standard_contexts: *standard_security_checks
```

When defining additional required checks, make sure workflow jobs have names so they can be referenced directly. Alternatively, you can reference job IDs. For workflows which use reusable workflows, the pattern is `<initial_workflow.jobs.job.[name/id]> / <reused-workflow.jobs.job.[name/id]`

Example configuration:
```
    required_status_checks:
      standard_contexts: *standard_govuk_rails_checks
      additional_contexts:
        - Test features / Run Cucumber
        - Lint JavaScript / Run Standardx
        - Test JavaScript / Run Jasmine
        - Test Ruby / Run RSpec
```

Note that private repositories can't use the predefined `standard_govuk_rails_checks` or `standard_security_checks`. In such cases, include a comment: `# standard security checks are disabled as not configured for a private repo`. You should define equivalent jobs in your repositoryâ€™s CI workflow and reference them in the `additional_contexts` section of the required status checks.

### Private repositories

Private repositories should be treated as exceptions. We should [make new source code open](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-12-make-new-source-code-open) in accordance with [point 3 of the Technology Code of Practice](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice). Only create a private repository if there are legitimate [grounds for keeping the code closed](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/open-source-guidance/when-code-should-be-open-or-closed). 

To configure a `private` or `internal` repository, set the `visibility` explicitly: 
```
  visibility: private
```

Note: Private repositories can't use GitHub Actions workflows that upload SARIF files, and therefore can't use the predefined standard security checks.

### Adding existing repositories 

> Skip this step if you are creating a new repository.

To manage an **existing** repository using the GOV.UK GitHub Infrastructure configuration, it needs to be imported into terraform state. Otherwise terraform apply will fail attempting to create a repository that already exists. 

To import the resource, use an import block:
```
import {
  to = github_repository.govuk_repos["govuk-existing-repo-name"]
  id = "govuk-existing-repo-name"
}
```

[Example commit of importing an existing repository](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/commit/c6774a7d42ca2eb9b0987a51cde8b57e13e0577f). Note that the code only has to run once so it's ok to remove old entries.

If you've manually configured branch protection rules, you'll need to import them using the block below. Alternatively, you can delete the existing rules via the GitHub UI and allow Terraform to recreate them.
```
import {
  to = github_branch_protection.govuk_repos["govuk-existing-repo-name"]
  id = "govuk-existing-repo-name:main"
}
```

### Apply terraform changes

Before merging your Pull Request, review the Terraform plan carefully. 
After the PR is merged, remember to review it again and to apply changes in [Terraform Cloud GitHub workspace](https://app.terraform.io/app/govuk/workspaces/GitHub/runs).


## Archiving repositories

To archive a repository, you will need to raise **two** Pull Requests to update the repository's configuration in the [repos.yml](/terraform/deployments/github/repos.yml) file.

1. Remove all properties

Remove all properties such as `required_status_checks` or `homepage_url`.

```diff
- my-repo:
-  can_be_deployed: true
-  homepage_url: "https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/repos/my-repo.html"
-  required_status_checks:
-    standard_contexts: *standard_govuk_rails_checks
-    additional_contexts:
-      - Test Ruby
-      - Lint JavaScript / Run Standardx
-      - Lint SCSS / Run Stylelint
+  my-repo: {}
```

Raise a Pull Request and review the Terraform plan carefully. Once approved, merge the PR. Remember to apply the Terraform changes after reviewing the plan output again in [Terraform Cloud GitHub workspace](https://app.terraform.io/app/govuk/workspaces/GitHub/runs).

2. Add the `archived: true` property

```diff
-  my-repo: {}
+  my-repo:
+    archived: true
```

Raise a Pull Request. Review the Terraform plan carefully.

The Terraform Deployment will run a series of precondition checks to catch any outstanding PRs or unaddressed Github Pages configuration. If you have missed any, the Terraform Plan will fail and you should back go over previous steps in the [Retire a repo](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/retiring-a-repo.html) manual again to make sure nothing has been overlooked.

Once the PR is approved, merge it. Then apply the Terraform changes after reviewing the plan output again in [Terraform Cloud GitHub workspace](https://app.terraform.io/app/govuk/workspaces/GitHub/runs).
