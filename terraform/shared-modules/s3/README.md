# Secure S3 bucket Terraform module

The motivation is to offer an easy to use module to quickly create a secure s3 bucket. The bucket has an enforced no public access and a HTTPS only policy configured as an enforced standard. Configurable options include versioning, encryption, IAM policies and lifecycle rules

Designed as a user-facing module see (./Usage.md)[./USAGE.md] for more implementation details.
