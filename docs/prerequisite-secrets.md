# Prerequisite Secrets

The platform requires some prerequisite secrets in order to fully function.
These secrets are stores in AWS Secret Manager, further info about the integration
of the k8s platform platform with AWS Secret Manager is available [here](kubernetes-external-secrets.md)

The secrets listed here are either:
1. externally generated in external systems and imported into our platform. E.g.
   GitHub OAUTH secret; or
2. generated manually and used between different components of our platform.
   We don't have a method yet to autogenerate these. E.g. OAUTH shared secret between
   ArgoCD (continuous delivery tool) and Dex (federated OpenID Connect provider).
3. GOV.UK app specific secrets which are referred to in
   [app-config](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/app-config/templates/external-secrets)
   helm chart of the [govuk-helm-charts] GitHub repository. These are usually copied across from
   from [govuk-secrets](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-secrets)

The canonical source of all the platform secrets required are listed
[here](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/cluster-secrets/templates)
in the [govuk-helm-charts] GitHub repository.

The purpose of this document is to provide information about:
1. how these secrets are generated/obtained exactly
2. the JSON format to use when adding the secrets to AWS Secret Manager

The format of secret is given below to aid creation from scratch:  
`name of the secret in AWS Secrets Manager`: Description

```
{
  <key_1>: <secret_1>,
  <key_2>: <secret_2>
}
```

In addition, there are

     "clientSecret": "<secret_2>"
   }
   ```

3. `govuk/dex/grafana`: shared OAUTH secret between Dex and Grafana.

  ```

6. `govuk/fastly/api`: used by Fastly exporter in k8s to scrape Fastly metrics.
   Created in the Fastly management web console by creating a user which has access
   only to the fastly service associated with a particular GOV.UK environment.

   ```
   {
     "token": "<secret_1>"
