# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2021-08-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

Read Michael Nygard's article for the consequences for choosing to keep Architecture Decision Records. For a lightweight
ADR tool set, see [Nat Pryce's `adr-tools`](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
